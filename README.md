# MakeBigSlackEmoji!!

This repository is a tiny project that you can clone so that you can create MASSIVE slack emoji images!!! 

The output image will be put in the output directory named `<image-name>-output`.

## Notices

In its current state this does not upload the emojis for you, I recommend using [this chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neutral-face-emoji-tools/anchoacphlfbdomdlomnbbfhcmcdmjej)

## Usage

To use simply install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` (ideally in a virtual environment) and then run the following command!

```
python make-big-slack-emoji.py <image-name>
```
